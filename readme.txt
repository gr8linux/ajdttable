== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* Can I use generated REST api in my custom modules? What authentication method should I use? 
Yes, you need to WordPress Cookie Authentication('X-WP-Nonce'). For more info about Cookie Authentication, please refer: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/
* What are the HTTP Methods supported ?
GET, POST and DELETE
* How to render API data  from php code?
Use  echo do_shortcode("[AJDT api='MY-API-NAME']"); Here the MY-API-NAME is the user defined name provided while creating the API.
* My shortcode is not working !
If shortcode content is not seen printed, check the WP settings to see if any option is enabled to restrict where and when shortcode is printed. Also confirm if the shortcode API-NAME is correct and there is no duplicate `api` attribute for the shortcode. Please try the shortcode content in an isolated environment and confirm if the shortcode content is working correctly as expected.
